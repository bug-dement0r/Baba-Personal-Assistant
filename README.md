enter text manually. It uses the SpVoice object to bring the text-to-speech (TTS) engine capabilities to applications 
using SAPI automation. An application can create numerous SpVoice objects, each independent of and capable of interacting
with the others. An SpVoice object, usually referred to simply as a voice, is created with default property settings so that
it is ready to speak immediately. Baba can also perform local functions like opening music files for listening music, clearing 
recycle bin and locking the pc. Users can also use Baba to get the unread emails, to check the weather, or any other query.
